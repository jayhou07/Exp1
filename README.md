Now  I add a sentense and commit the changes in my branTest1.

There are two things I'm gonna figure out:

​	1.how to roll back

​	2.how to use branch



Yeah, I got it.  Things  I wanna know : 1. can github for windows run offline?

								 *2.  what happened when I  change it to a new branch								 *2.  what happened when I  change it to a new branch

Interesting.  Well, first , gfw(github for windows) does work offline.

​	 	      Next, I found the relationship between /master and branch/ is kind of  /the model of inheritance/.  What you've changed in master will turn up in the branch. However, the history of branch revision won't show up in the one of master.(oop, ah)
>>>>>>> master

--that is total a mess--
